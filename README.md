My introduction to using Hugging Face Transformer Models with PyTorch.

## Requirements

*You need to have pytorch installed. Using Anaconda is the method I chose for simplicity*

```bash
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
```

- PyTorch Install: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

### Python Dependencies:

*I would suggest creating a python venv*

- venv Setup: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html

- requirements.txt
    - ```bash
        pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
